<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>Hi, all. Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
<p>I played a lot of games, worked for game companies and I like developing them! I mainly focus on strategy games, but also like visual novel, RPG and factory games. My favourite part is gameplay innovations in games and would like to work for that. </p>
<p>If there is no other plan, I will start to work on my first serious personal project - Battles in War - on 2024 Feb. It will be a 2.5D hexagon war game which focus on the relation between battles and war. I hope it will someday match the achievements of Alice project(V2 rework).</p>

A very cool game on steam, although not finished yet. I am responsible for its UI and its interfaces with other game systems like pop and map.</li>

A top down 2D shooting game similar to &quot;Battle city&quot;. This is just a course project, but also my first project designed and implemented purely by myself (Except for sound effect part). So I think it is worth mentioning. </li>
